# ChatGPT Implementation / setup

This fragment of project is a implementation of ChatGPT 3.5/4.
I used Open AI API from NuGet in C#/.Net

There is no ChatGPT API Key uploaded because of .gitignore/.env.
If you want to test if it works or not, you need to input your API Key for ChatGPT. In order to input your own .env file, you need to put it in the bin file since that is where the program will compile to runable code. 

.env should look something like: 
"OPEN_AI_API=sk.......69420"

For next sprint...
- I will be making sure the user can append their input so that they can keep the conversation going with ChatGPT.
- I will be coding React Native part of the chatbox. (Need to talk with Christian Rudder for load distribution on React Native)
- I will help others if needed 

Here is demo:
